        <h2>Investment Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          In the backbone of the American economy lie established, family-owned,
          and founder-led businesses with deep market knowledge and loyal
          customers. While rich in history, many of these companies possess
          significant, untapped potential locked away by legacy systems and
          operational inertia.
        </p>
        <p>
          West Harbor Equity Partners acquires a select number of these great
          companies and provides the strategic capital and technological
          expertise necessary to make them exceptional. We are not passive
          investors; we are hands-on operators who partner with management to
          implement sophisticated automation and AI-driven frameworks, unlocking
          new levels of efficiency and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach is built on a foundation of respect for the company's
          heritage and a clear vision for its future. We create long-term,
          sustainable value for our partners, our employees, and our investors.
